Mental health issues continue to be a pervasive global concern, affecting millions of individuals. Despite increased awareness, there is a persistent gap in accessible, personalized, and innovative mental health solutions. Conventional approaches often face challenges in engaging individuals and providing timely interventions. Moreover, the stigma associated with mental health prevents many from seeking help. We have tried to make people aware of the options they can take by using VR technology to give a virtual reality experience. 
To launch the application, open the Unity project in the Unity software and click "Play" in the main scene. Use the designated controls, such as a keyboard, mouse, or VR controller, to navigate through the virtual environment. Move towards room entry points to access different areas.
Explore using controls and move towards entry points to access rooms.
In the Game Room, interact with gaming consoles for virtual games. In the Rage Room, press and lift virtual glass objects, releasing the mouse grip to drop them. In the Meditation Room, immerse yourself in the serene environment.
Start in the lobby and use interactive displays or prompts to select rooms.
